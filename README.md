# Wot-Ah

Wot-Ah provides you with locations of fountains or other locations you can get drinking water from.
I called it "Wot-Ah" cause it sounds like a british person saying "water".
Thaught I could be kinda funny :)


## Where's the data from?

At the moment all the data is from OSM (OpenStreetMap.org). If I get some more time to work on this,
I might implement some way of adding new locations to make this map more useful.
